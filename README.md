# **_Home_Grown_App_** üçáüçéüçÖü•ïüåΩüßëüèª‚Äçüåæ

Welcome to Home-Grown!

Our team at the School of Code bootcamp came together with the goal of addressing real-world issues that are interconnected and impact our society. Through brainstorming and discussion, we identified climate change, the cost of living, and a lack of community as significant problems. In response, we developed an app to empower individuals to take steps towards a more sustainable, self-sufficient, and community-oriented future. Though our app may not solve these complex issues, it aims to provide guidance and resources to individuals looking to make a positive impact in their communities.

Elevator Pitch:

Are you looking to save money, eat more healthily, learn new skills and join a community? Home Grown connects you to your local food growing community whether you've got your own growing space or not! Find food friends, track your progress and gain access to our growing guide.

**This README is for the front-end of the Home-Grown app. If you would like to explore the back-end of the app please go to the [backend repository](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc13_final-project_back-end-maccaw.git)**
